In Spring 2023 I served as a teaching assistant for *Algorithm for Big Data* under the instruction of Prof. [Pan Peng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ppeng/). The textbook and official lecture notes by instructor is in English, which is a challenge to most students. In order to reduce the burden on students, I wrote some notes in Chinese with some own understanding of this course.
