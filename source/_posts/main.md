Welcome to my blog and homepage! I am Xiaoyang Xu (徐笑阳), an undergraduate from [School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Computer Science. My research interest is mainly about Optimization and Theoretical Computer Science, as I love tackling Maths problems related to Computers. This homepage is newly built under renovation.
