# About Me

I am an undergraduate student of School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in computer science. I am honored to have the opportunity to attend the Huaxia Computer Technology Talent Program.

I am eager to take part in undergraduate research opportunities to gain practical experience. I have a broad range of interests within mathematical problems in computer science, especially in the fields of mathematical optimizations, data structures, analysis of algorithms and their applications in machine learning and data analysis.

Currently, I am working in Professor [Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/)'s group on a research project about exploiting optimization techniques to find Lyapnov certificates, which have its application in optimal control. In this project I am exploring SDP techniques together with first order properties to avoid the costly computation of Hessian in conventional SDP algorithms. My last project was about using an innovative data structure to solve dynamic Optimal Transport problem with Professor [Hu Ding](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~huding/), which has been submitted to NeurIPS 2023.

I have a passion for competitive programming. I have won several prizes in competitions such as ICPC, which have helped me to develop my problem-solving and coding skills.

# Education and Training

## Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology

**[University of Science and Technology of China](https://ustc.edu.cn/)** *Sep 2020 - Current*

**GPA:** 3.93/4.3
**Weighted Average:** 91.23
**Transcript:** [Download here](/cv/ScholasticRecord.pdf)

During the pursuit of my bachelor's degree, I acquired expertise in the following areas:

1. Algorithms such as Data Structures, Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Numerical Computing
2. Mathematics such as Combinatorics, Graph Theory, Probability Theory, Linear Algebra, Number Theory, Calculus and Mathematical Logic
3. Programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Matlab, x86 assembly and Verilog
4. Computer system theories such as Compiler Principles, Computer Architectures and Operating Systems

# Work Experience

## Student Intern

**[Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/) @ Harvard** *2023.08 - Current*

This work is mainly about solving SDP proposed in searching Lyapnov certificate. Searching Lyapnov certificate could be transformed into an SOS problem, which could be casted into a SDP problem. Such SDP problem has many properties, e.g. the constraints are all linear, the objective is only to find a feasible solution, the coefficient matrix in linear constraints is sparce. As current second order algorithms like interior point method requires the expensive calculation of Hessian, we are exploiting the first order properties of this problem for saving time and memory.

## Research Assistant

**[Hu Ding](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~huding/) @ USTC** *2021.08 - 2023.07*

In this project, we designed and implemented a data dependent algorithm for discrete optimial transport. We focus on using simplex methods and attempt to use data structures to improve both the time upper bound and actual performance about augmenting. From this research, I have improved my programming skills increased my knowledge in combinatorial optimizations.

## Teaching Assistant

**[Pan Peng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~ppeng/) @ USTC** *Feb 2023 - Jul 2023*

As a teaching assistant for "Algorithms for Big Data," I assisted in teaching a course that introduces new algorithmic techniques for handling big data, including topics such as random sampling, dimension reduction, data compression, distributed computing, streaming algorithms, clustering, classification, and stochastic optimization. The course also covers related theory and mathematics, such as probability foundations, VCdimension, communication complexity, and machine learning theory, and is designed to help students learn the basic theory and algorithms for handling big data problems. The class has a total enrollment of 131 students.
