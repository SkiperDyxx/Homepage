I am an undergraduate student of School of the Gifted Young, University of Science and Technology of China, majoring in computer science. I am honored to have the opportunity to attend the Huaxia Computer Technology Talent Program.

I am eager to take part in undergraduate research opportunities to gain practical experience. I have a broad range of interests within mathematical problems in computer science, especially in the fields of mathematical optimizations, data structures, analysis of algorithms and their applications in machine learning and data analysis.

Currently, I am working in Professor [Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/)'s group on a research project about exploiting optimization techniques to find Lyapnov certificates, which have its application in optimal control. In this project I am exploring SDP techniques together with first order properties to avoid the costly computation of Hessian in conventional SDP algorithms. My last project was about using an innovative data structure to solve dynamic Optimal Transport problem with Professor [Hu Ding](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~huding/), which has been submitted to NeurIPS 2023.

I have a passion for competitive programming. I have won several prizes in competitions such as ICPC, which have helped me to develop my problem-solving and coding skills.
